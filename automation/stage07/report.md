# Stage 07 Report

## Summary
- `make stage07-verify` rerun on 2025-10-31T12:24:26.089090+00:00 (UTC).
- Backend integration pytest suite passed again, confirming adapters under `backend/app/integrations` still operate as expected.
- Celery worker binary is available, but `celery inspect ping` continues to exit 69 against the ephemeral worker, so queue health is flagged for follow-up.
- Prometheus metrics snapshot captured in `automation/stage07/metrics.txt`; React monitoring UI remains unchanged.

## Integrations
- `crm_sync` → CRMIntegration
- `crm_cached` → CachedCRMIntegration
- `notifications` → NotificationIntegration
- `object_storage` → ObjectStorageIntegration

## Queue Configuration
- Broker: `redis://redis:6379/0`
- Result backend: `redis://redis:6379/1`
- Default queue: `integrations`

## Next Steps
- Run `make stage07-verify` to execute Celery checks and integration tests.
- Install frontend dependencies with `npm install --prefix frontend` and run `npm test --prefix frontend` for UI smoke verification.
