# Stage 06 Report

## Summary
- `make stage06-verify` rerun on 2025-10-31T12:23:41.524556+00:00 (UTC).
- Authentication module regression tests and Bandit scan remain green; frontend lint also passes.
- Playwright dependency installation still fails with `npm 403 Forbidden` while trying to download `playwright`, so end-to-end auth checks are blocked and the stage remains marked `failed`.
- Role definitions stay synchronised (4 roles) and security policies remain documented in `docs/security/policies.md`.
